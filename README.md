# Python Web Scraper
Python code in the job scraper repository is a program that scraps Python developer job postings in stackoverflow and indeed.com. A few modifications to the code allow you to scrape for other languages besides python. Print the scraped data in csv format.(If html tag is changed at stackoverflow and indeed.com, the change should be added to the code.)
